# RPGMakerMVDatabaseGenerator
This is a simple JSON generator for RPG Maker MV
Converting CSV file to JSON with a certain format
The output of this program is default + basic input on RPG Maker MV databases like parameters and names.
As for inputs like images, traits, etc. I leave it default or empty.

This program is run with python.
So the requirement to run this program is Python itself, you can download it on: https://python.org
If you are using GUI version no need to download anything else.

As for the CSV format I made one myself, you can download it from here: https://s.id/Dgyv8

2. Extract the folder.
3. Put the CSV file in same folder as the executable.
4. Run the program.
5. Open the file, select the output according to your choosen file, and generate.
6. The result will be inside folder outputs.
