# RPGMakerMVDatabaseGenerator
This is a simple JSON generator for RPG Maker MV
Converting CSV file to JSON with a certain format
The output of this program is default + basic input on RPG Maker MV databases like parameters and names.
As for inputs like images, traits, etc. I leave it default or empty.

This program is run with python.

So the requirement to run this program is Python itself, you can download it on: https://python.org

As for the format I made one myself, you can download it here: https://s.id/Dgyv8

# How to use
1. Download main.py file. It is safe.
2. Open your terminal/command prompt and direct to the main.py directory
3. Run this command on your terminal, `python main.py [CSV Filename] [Output]`
4. I assume you already downloaded python.

# Future Development
- Add more options output
- Add user friendly interface and make it executable, so users can use it right away.
